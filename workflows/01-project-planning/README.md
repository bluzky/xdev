# Workflow 1: Project Planning

**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**When:** Week 0, before development starts
**Output:** `docs/plan/master-plan.md`

---

## What to Do

Follow these 5 steps in order. Fill out the template.md as you go.

### Step 1: Gather Information (30 min)

Collect these before starting:
- [ ] What problem does this project solve?
- [ ] Who will use it?
- [ ] What are the core features (MVP)?
- [ ] Rough timeline (how many weeks?)
- [ ] Team size and skills?

**If you don't have this, get it from stakeholders first.**

---

### Step 2: Define Phases (45 min)

Most projects follow 4 phases:

1. **Preparation** (1 week) — Requirements, design, planning
2. **Build Core** (1-2 weeks) — Main features, MVP
3. **Integration** (1 week) — Connect everything, release MVP
4. **Polish** (1-2 weeks) — Refinements, edge cases, deployment

For each phase, write:
- **Duration:** How many weeks
- **Goal:** What does this phase deliver
- **Success:** How do we know it's done

---

### Step 3: Create Timeline (30 min)

List all weeks and assign phases:

```
Week 1: Phase 1 - Preparation
Week 2: Phase 2 - Frontend build
Week 3: Phase 2 - Frontend complete
Week 4: Phase 3 - Backend & integration
Week 5: Phase 4 - Polish & release
```

---

### Step 4: Define Success (30 min)

Write 3-5 measurable success criteria:

✅ Examples:
- MVP released by [date]
- All core features working end-to-end
- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- 100% test pass rate
- Ready for production use

❌ Bad examples:
- "Project is good"
- "Everything works"
- "Performance is fine"

---

### Step 5: Fill Template (45 min)

Copy `template.md` to `docs/plan/master-plan.md` and fill in:

1. Project overview (what you're building)
2. Phases (from Step 2)
3. Timeline (from Step 3)
4. Success metrics (from Step 4)
5. Team (who's involved)
6. Risks (what could go wrong)
