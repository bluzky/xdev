# Old Files - Archive

This directory contains the original comprehensive methodology documentation.

**These are archived.** Use the new simplified workflows instead:

→ Go to root directory and read [WORKFLOWS.md](../WORKFLOWS.md)

## What's Here

- **00-START-HERE.md** — Original quick start guide (superseded by WORKFLOWS.md)
- **METHODOLOGY_GUIDE.md** — Comprehensive methodology explanation (superseded by individual workflow READMEs)
- **README_TEMPLATES.md** — Original template index (superseded by workflows/)
- **guides/** — Detailed step-by-step guides (content now in workflow README files)
- **templates/** — Original templates (simplified versions in workflows/)

---

## Why Archive?

The new structure is:
- **Simpler** — 5 clear workflows instead of 10 documents
- **Faster** — 1-2 page READMEs instead of 14K guides
- **AI-Friendly** — Clear entry points and step-by-step instructions
- **Organized** — Grouped by when you use them (Project → Weekly → Daily)

## If You Need the Original

Everything is still here for reference. But start with [../WORKFLOWS.md](../WORKFLOWS.md) instead.

The content is the same, just reorganized for clarity.
